# NVIDIA RTX 3060 Installation


## 1. Pre-Flight

1. Complete all other optimizations - middleware, manual, script.
1. [Download the NVIDIA Studio Driver branch](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/).
    - Resolve 19 has severe conflicts with recent Game Ready drivers.
1. Ensure you can sign in if things go sideways:     
    - Turn off Settings > Accounts > Sign-in options: Only allow Windows Hello sign-in (PIN)
    - Be sure to have your Microsoft Live account password.


## 2. Suspend BitLocker

The GPU is tied to the TPM security chip. If we install it without suspending BitLocker, Windows will lock us out and demand a 48-digit recovery key upon reboot.

When you use the GUI to suspend BitLocker, it will auto-restart on the next boot - we don't want this. These steps permanently suspend BitLocker until we're confident the new GPU is working. 

1. Start > Manage BitLocker: Back up your recovery key

2. Check BitLocker status and protection level: 

```PowerShell
# Check 
manage-bde -status C:

# Result
BitLocker Drive Encryption: Configuration Tool version 10.0.26100
Copyright (C) 2013 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

Volume C: [OS]
[OS Volume]

Size:                 453.77 GB
BitLocker Version:    2.0
Conversion Status:    Used Space Only Encrypted
Percentage Encrypted: 100.0%
Encryption Method:    XTS-AES 128
Protection Status:    Protection On
Lock Status:          Unlocked
Identification Field: Unknown
Key Protectors:
    TPM
    Numerical Password

```

3. Suspend BitLocker and check:

```PowerShell
# 1. Suspend BitLocker indefinitely (RebootCount 0)
Suspend-BitLocker -MountPoint "C:" -RebootCount 0

# 2. Verify Protection Status = Protection Off
manage-bde -status C:

# 3. Reboot PC and check still Off
manage-bde -status C:

```

## 3. Disable Driver Searching

These steps prevent Windows from interfering with manual driver installation later. First, confirm Windows keys: 

```PowerShell
# 1. Confirm this exists: 
$Reg_Path = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\DriverSearching"
Get-ItemProperty -Path $Reg_Path | Select-Object * -ExcludeProperty ps*

SearchOrderConfig = 1

# 2. Confirm this exists: 
$Reg_Path = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Device Metadata"
Get-ItemProperty -Path $Reg_Path | Select-Object * -ExcludeProperty ps*

CheckBackMDNotRetrieved = 5
CheckBackMDRetrieved = 8
PreventDeviceMetadataFromNetwork = 0

```

Then temporarily configure: 

```Powershell
# 1. Block Windows Update from auto-installing generic drivers
$Reg_Path = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\DriverSearching"
Set-ItemProperty -Path $Reg_Path -Name "SearchOrderConfig" -Value 0

# 2. Block Device Metadata networking (Prevents background driver scans)
$Reg_Path = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Device Metadata"
Set-ItemProperty -Path $Reg_Path -Name "PreventDeviceMetadataFromNetwork" -Value 1

```

## 4. Physical Installation

1. Shut down the workstation and remove the power cable.
1. Press and hold the power button for 10 seconds to discharge flea power.
1. Install the RTX card into the primary PCIe x16 slot.
1. Use individual power cables from the power supply to each port on the GPU.
1. Do not use pigtail or splitter cables to avoid voltage drops during renders.
1. Reassemble the chassis and connect the display to the RTX card Display1.


## 5. BIOS Configuration

1. Power on. F2 to enter BIOS.

1. Disable Secure Boot to prevent firmware signature mismatches with the moved GPU. This will be re-enabled post GPU: 

    - Boot Configuration > Secure Boot = Off [On]

1. Disable DMA Protection to prevent the OS from sandboxing the GPU, which can cause micro-stutters during heavy VRAM usage. These will remain off permanently:  

    - Virtualization Support > Enable Pre-Boot DMA Support = Off [On]
    - Virtualization Support > Enable OS Kernel DMA Support = Off [On] 
    - Virtualization Support > Internal Port DMA Compatibility Mode = [Disabled]

1. Enable BAR to allow the Intel Core Ultra 7 265K to access the entire GPU frame buffer. This should already be on: 

    - Performance > PCIe Resizable Base Address Register (BAR) = [On]

1. Save the settings and exit the BIOS to boot into Windows.


## 6. Validate Hardware

Before installing drivers, confirm the system has successfully negotiated with the foreign hardware.

```PowerShell
# 1. Check the status of the new display adapter
Get-PnpDevice -Class Display | Select-Object FriendlyName, Status, InstanceId

# Result
FriendlyName                    Status InstanceId
------------                    ------ ----------
Microsoft Basic Display Adapter OK     PCI\VEN_10DE&DEV_2504&SUBSYS_C9741028&REV_A1\4&98469B2&0&0030
Intel(R) Graphics               OK     PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_7D67&SUBSYS_0CD81028&REV_06\3&11583659&0&10


# 2. Confirm Kernel DMA Protection is inactive
Get-ComputerInfo | Select-Object DeviceGuardSmartSyncProtectionStatus

# Result should be blank like: 
DeviceGuardSmartSyncProtectionStatus
------------------------------------

```

## 7. Install Drivers

Perform a clean install to wipe the previous hardware profile and reset the NVIDIA Display Container service. This is critical because the optimization scripts target specific registry paths that only exist after a clean init.

1. Select: NVIDIA Graphics Driver and NVIDIA App
1. Installation Options = Custom (Advanced)
1. Custom Installation Options > Perform a clean installation = True

Launch NVIDIA App:  

1. Ensure NVIDIA Studio Driver is selected. Click Next.
1. Optimize games and creative apps = True
1. Enable the NVIDIA Overlay = False

Launch NVIDIA Control Panel: 

1. Click System Information (bottom-left corner).
1. Check Resizable BAR = Yes.


## 8. Restore Driver Searching

```PowerShell
# 1. Un-Block Windows Update 
$Reg_Path = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\DriverSearching"
Set-ItemProperty -Path $Reg_Path -Name "SearchOrderConfig" -Value 1

# 2. Un-Block Device Metadata networking 
$Reg_Path = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Device Metadata"
Set-ItemProperty -Path $Reg_Path -Name "PreventDeviceMetadataFromNetwork" -Value 0

```

## 9. Re-Enable Secure Boot

1. Restart. F2 to enter BIOS.
1. Boot Configuration > Secure Boot = [On]
1. Save and Exit to boot to Windows.
1. Validate Secure Boot is back on:

```PowerShell
# Check security features status
Get-ComputerInfo | Select-Object DeviceGuardSmartSyncProtectionStatus, SecureBootStatus

```

## 10. Un-Suspend BitLocker

```PowerShell
# 1. Resume BitLocker protection
Resume-BitLocker -MountPoint "C:"

# 2. Verify Protection Status = Protection On
manage-bde -status C:

```

## 11. NVIDIA App 

1. NVIDIA App > Graphics > Global Settings tab
1. Scroll down and click to expand 'Legacy Settings`.
1. Configure these: 

| Setting                     | Target Value               | Why?     |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------- |
| Power management mode       | Prefer maximum performance | Keeps GPU clocks high to prevent laggy playback during color work. |
| Open GL GDI compatibility   | Prefer Performance         | Accelerates 2D UI overlays on top of 3D viewports. |
| Vertical sync               | Off                        | Prevents the 60fps cap; essential for smooth Fusion UI responsiveness. |
| Low Latency Mode            | On                         | Reduces the render queue to make timeline scrubbing feel instant. |
| Texture filtering - Quality | High performance           | Bypasses redundant driver filtering to speed up frame processing. |
| Multi-Frame Sampled AA      | Off                        | Prevents artificial smoothing that can mask noise or render artifacts. |
| Background Application Max Frame Rate | Off              | Ensures background renders (Resolve/Media Encoder) run at full speed.  |


Also check System > Displays tab: G-Synch.

- For me it is not available and this is ideal.
- If available, forcing a 'fixed refresh rate' helps prevent Substance viewport flickering.


## 12. NVIDIA Control Panel

1. NVIDIA Control Panel > Display > Display Resolution 
1. (1) Select display (click to select)
1. (3) Apply the following settings: Use NVIDIA color settings = True
1. Configure these: 

| Setting                     | Target Value               | Why?     |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------- |
| Desktop Color Depth         | Highest (32-bit)           | Default
| Output color depth          | 10 bpc (if avail)          | Critical for 10-bit grading in Resolve to prevent banding.    |
| Output color format         | RGB                        | Ensures the most accurate color reproduction for PC monitors. |
| Output dynamic range        | Full (0-255)               | Fixes the gamma shift bug where blacks appear as dark grey.   |
